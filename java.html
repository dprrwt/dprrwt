                <br /><br />
                Conditional-And: &&:
                Scene: Loki's capture where both Captain America and Iron Man have to work together to succeed.
                Association: Just as BOTH heroes had to collaborate for a common goal (like an AND condition), the "&&" operator requires both conditions to be true to proceed.
                <br /><br />
                Conditional-Or: ||:
                Scene: The team debating on the Helicarrier about how to handle Loki, where there are multiple valid strategies.
                Association: The team could go with Stark's plan OR Rogers' plan OR another approach. Like the "||" operator, only one of the conditions has to be true to proceed.
                <br /><br />
                Logical NOT: !:
                Scene: The moment when Black Widow tricks Loki into revealing his plans while pretending to be scared.
                Association: Natasha's true intentions were NOT aligned with what she showed outwardly, much like the "!" operator which inverts a true condition to false or vice versa.
                <br /><br />
                Combining Conditional Operators:
                Scene: The Battle of New York, where the Avengers have to make multiple tactical decisions on the fly, considering various conditions.
                Association: They had to evaluate multiple scenarios: if an area is under attack AND civilians are in danger, they need to defend; if Thor is occupied OR Hulk is unavailable, then another Avenger should step in. Combining operators helps in evaluating complex conditions, much like the team combining strengths.
